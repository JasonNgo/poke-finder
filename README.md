Poke-Finder

FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

Record your sightings of pokemon you find around the world!

Program specifications:
- When tapping the pokeball on the main screen a sighting is saved. The location saved is the center the of map.
- When exiting and re-entering the map previously saved locations should load if the user is within a 2.5 km radius of saved sightings.

Improvements:
- Currently when tapping the pokeball a random pokemon is saved. This can be improved upon by having a view that contains search functionality where you can choose which pokemon sighting you wish to save.
